The [Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.google.com/docs/growing/peer-bonus/) program is described as:

> _In the same way that a Google Peer Bonus is used to recognize a fellow Googler who has gone above and beyond, an Open Source Peer Bonus recognizes external people who have made exceptional contributions to open source._

Yang and Casbin are listed among open source developers and projects that have a relevant impact out there, like Git, TensorFlow, V8, CPython, LLVM, Apache projects, Angular or Jenkins.

We are glad to see Casbin recognized in this way for its contribution to open source and cloud security!

_Thanks for flying Casbin!_
